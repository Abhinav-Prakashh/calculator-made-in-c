# calculator-made-in-c
 In this project, I made a simple calculator program using c language.<br>
 This contains operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and finding the square root of a number.<br>
 This program is written in c language.<br>
 The file named calculator.exe is the program and the code is also there in the .c file.
